# Python cheatsheet / 'knowledge organiser'

Python is a cool scripting language

Here's some stuff

## Types

The basic types in python

### Primitive

```python
aNumber = 90
aFloat = float('3.1456789')
aString = 'this is a string, it can use speech marks too'
```

### Object Oriented

```python
anArray = ['string', 99, ['arrayception', 'iscool']]
anObject = rang(0, 15) # returns an iterable object
```

## Iteration

```python
# while loop
expression = True
while expression:
    print('something')
    if expression == True:
        expression = False

# for loop

for i in range(0, 15):
    print(i) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ....

```

## Conditionals and Equality operators

| Operator | Description           |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `<`      | less than             |
| `>`      | more than             |
| `<=`     | More than or equal to |
| `>=`     | Less than or equal to |
| `==`     | Equal to              |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          |
| `is`     | Strictly equal to     |

### If statement

```python
if 50 > 20:
    print('true')
```

That same syntantic sugar with expressions in statements can be used in iteration and switch statements.

## File streams

The open functions uses file streams

## Random numbers

Using the random module with `import random` with documentation at [random docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html)

## Drawing

The built in turtle module does that with `import turtle`
Documentation available online
