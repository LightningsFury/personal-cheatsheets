# Python cheatsheet / 'knowledge organiser'

Python is a cool scripting language

Here's some stuff

## Types
The basic types in python
### Primitive

```python
aNumber = 90
aFloat = float('3.1456789')
aString = 'this is a string, it can use speech marks too'
```

### Object Oriented

```python
anArray = ['string', 99, ['arrayception', 'iscool']]
anObject = rang(0, 15) # returns an iterable object
```

## Iteration

```python
# while loop
expression = True
while expression:
    print('something')
    if expression == True:
        expression = False

# for loop

for i in range(0, 15):
    print(i) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ....

```

## File streams

The open functions uses file streams

## Drawing

The built in turtle module does that with `import turtle`
